A while later, a group of men and women arrive wearing brooches depicting a griffin holding a dozen roses. They investigate the area and perform rituals to detect where the magic user went. A woman holds out her hand to the crying Stanley. Stanley, as a middle aged man is briefed that a dark sorcerer has invaded the government and works an ambassador. She is dangerous and has sealed many operatives in a silver box. Stanley breaks into her office and breaks the silver box. He then waits for her in the dark. When she arrives, he jumps out and attacks, stabbing her in the chest. He incants "thy soul shalt be condemned to that faraway place, the island of the lost". They are both sucked into the void. STANLEY is SHOCKED.
