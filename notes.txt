Lore:

Magic Users:
  Ophelia, Edra, Rhode
Mage Hunters:
  Stanley, Meredith, Merek
Bystanders:
  Arden

Throughout history magic users have been hunted. Each of the
groups of people died suddenly due to these conflicts. The
mage hunters are of a secret order that has existed throughout
history called the Order of the Griffin. They have a single
spell that they can cast which binds the soul of the mage
that they are hunting so that they can't escape. However,
the spell requires that the hunter binds their own soul as
well. Souls bound by the spell are sent to The Island.

The Island is an extradimensional space where the souls of
those bound by the hunters would go. There, the souls slowly
go mad and lose their memories. Once they've lost the last of
their memories, they dissipate into nothingness. Those powerful
enough or willful enough cling to shadowy memories of their past
and can remain on The Island for a long, long time.

In the middle ages, Merek confronted Rhode and both
were bound by Merek's spell. Their battle saw them both
fatally wounded and their souls were transported to The
Island.

In the 1990s, Edra, the sorcerer, finally convinced his
uptight brother to go for a road trip in his hotrod.
Unbeknownst to Edra, he was being tracked by an agent of the
Order of the Griffin named Meredith. She followed them on 
their trip and attacked while on a stretch of lonely highway.
Their magical battle destroyed both vehicles, trapping them
all, including the innocent bystander Arden, on The Island.

In the 2040s, Stanley, an agent of the Order of the Griffin,
worked undercover as a security guard. He knew that one of the
ambassadors was a mage. Eventually, he discovered it was
Ophelia. He ambushed her in her office but in the battle they
were both slain. He succeeded in killing her but he lived only
another 6 months as the curse slowly killed him. Eventually,
they were both transported to The Island.

Many more throughout history have been transported here. And
indeed, the player is one of them. The player is a wizard, 
slain by an agent of the Order of the Griffin in their own
time. Both died in the battle and were sent to The Island.
