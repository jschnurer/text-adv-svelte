  "description": "You're in a small, rocky cave. It smells of salt and seagulls. Light filters in from the south, revealing a chamber of rough gray stone. There are long-abandoned bird nests all over the chamber's floor.\nTo the south, the cave opens up to the ocean air and heads out onto a ledge. To the north, it continues into darkness.",
