    "You're standing in a shrouded cavern. Almost no light at all filters in through all the thick forest growth covering the south exit. Some small critters must have made this cavern their home. Dead grasses and leaves are heaped into nests near the corners of the small chamber. Rat droppings are basically everywhere. It's an unpleasant smell.",
