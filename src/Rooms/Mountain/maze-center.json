  "description": [
    "You're standing in the center of the labyrinth halfway through a wide passage that connects the northern and southern gates. It's a straight shot through this labyrinth. That doesn't strike you as particularly labyrinthine.",
    "Side passages to the east and west lead into twisting, turning passages. The wide passage also leads south toward the southern gate or north to the northern gate."
