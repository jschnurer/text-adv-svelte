    "You're standing just inside the labyrinth, near the northern gate. There's a wide passage straight ahead of you that leads all the way to the south gate on the far side of the labyrinth. It's a straight shot through this labyrinth. That doesn't strike you as particularly labyrinthine.",
    "Side passages to the east and west lead into twisting, turning passages. To the north, the gate leads outside the labyrinth."
