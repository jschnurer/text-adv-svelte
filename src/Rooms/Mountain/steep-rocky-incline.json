    "You are standing on a steep rocky incline on the side of the black mountain. The stones beneath your feet are jet black and a little shiny. It reminds you of Dragonglass, from some fantasy story you heard once.",
    "To the south and far below you, you can see a vast forest bisected by a river. Beyond that you see a swamp and eventually the coastline. You can just make out a lighthouse there, sweeping the horizon with its rotating light.",
    "The tortuous, rocky path leads ever higher to the west. It also leads downward to the east."
