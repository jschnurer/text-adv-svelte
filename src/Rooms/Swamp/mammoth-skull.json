There is a massive, half-buried skull here with long tusks. Oh! It's the skull of a... a... You can't quite remember.\nYou can see giant mosquitoes the size of housecats buzzing around in the distance all over the swamp. Some hover nearby, waiting for you to stop paying attention. Occasionally, one draws near and you bat it away.\nThe swampy terrain heads north and west. To the east, you can see the faint traces of a trail that heads toward solid ground. To the northwest is a fetid lake.",
